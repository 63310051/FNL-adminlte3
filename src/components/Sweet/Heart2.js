                ü§ç Cooking, when you look at it, is chemistry. Combining
                substances, applying heat in various ways, causing chemical
                reactions.{" "}

                Some bake follow recipes very precisely. They are trying to
                recreate someone else‚Äôs creation. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with
                this. It can be done out of love - a mother loves her family and
                wants to make them a home-baked meal, follows a recipe, and the
                result is perfectly satisfactory.{" "}

                But some bake, myself included, like to put their own spin on
                things. I cook for the √ºber-hub and myself most of the time, so
                I put in lots of spicy peppers because we like our food to make
                us sweat. Butter, cream, paprika, onions, fresh thyme‚Ä¶these are
                some of our favorite ingredients and I use them often.{" "}

                When I‚Äôm cooking for his mother, I use a lot less chilis because
                spicy foods upset her stomach. She doesn‚Äôt care for onions, so I
                leave those out.{" "}

                I‚Äôm cooking with heart, because I‚Äôm doing it with love and
                adjusting for the tastes of my audience. ü§ç{" "}
