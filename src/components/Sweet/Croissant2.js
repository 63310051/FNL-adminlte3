                Place warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle with

                ü§ç he technique is pretty straightforward, but be sure to pay
                attention to the temperature of your butter. If your slab is too
                soft, it will just blend into the dough and you won't get the
                gorgeous layering. And if it's too cold and firm, it won't
                spread between the layers of dough like it needs to.{" "}

                time, and when in doubt, pop the dough in the fridge for a few
